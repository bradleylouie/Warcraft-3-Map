# Warcraft-3-Map
Contains the complete code for two heroes, their foundation, their resource systems, enemy debuffs/hitstuns, and the modified hud. Many resources created by experienced modders from hiveworkshop are utilized but not included. The most frequently used of these are TimerUtils by Vexorian, and Table by Bribe. Much of the space formatting is inconsistent when read as plaintext on Github.
